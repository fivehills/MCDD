## About

The Multi-Lingual Corpus of Discourse Dependencies (MDCC) is a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate research and development in the field of discourse analysis across multiple languages. It provides annotated dependency information on discourse structures for 12 languages. Moreover, each language has eye-trakcing data on fixuation duration for reading each word and sentence. All this makes the corpus a valuable resource for computational linguistics, natural language processing, cognitive studies and multilingual studies. 

## Features

- **Multilingual Coverage**: The corpus includes discourse dependency annotations for the following 12 languages:
  Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish

- **Discourse Dependency Annotations**: Each language corpus includes detailed annotations that capture the dependency relations within discourse structures. This allows for a deeper understanding of how sentences and larger text units are connected and interact with each other in various languages.

- **Research and Development**: The MDCC aims to support a wide range of research activities, including cross-linguistic studies, development of multilingual NLP tools, and comparative discourse analysis. It is designed to be a foundational resource that can grow and evolve, similar to the Universal Dependencies project.

- **Future Expansion**: The MDCC is envisioned to expand over time, incorporating more languages and refining its annotations. The goal is to play a role similar to that of Universal Dependencies, providing a standardized framework for discourse analysis across an even broader spectrum of languages.

- **Future Expansion**: The MDCC includes eye-tracking data for reading each word and sentence. It allows for computational cognitive research. It helps make further explorations between human reading and language processing and the discourse structure.

## Usage

Researchers and developers can utilize the MDCC for various applications, including but not limited to:
- Developing and testing multilingual discourse parsers.
- Conducting comparative studies of discourse structures across different languages.
- Enhancing machine translation systems with better discourse coherence.
- Improving language models with nuanced understanding of discourse relations.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank all the contributors and institutions that have supported the development of the MDCC. You can contribute more datasets for more language. We hope that this dataset could be become discourse-style Universal Dependencies. Your efforts are invaluable in advancing multilingual discourse analysis.
