The Multi-lingual Eye-movement Corpus (MECO) is an ideal corpus to perform the further annotations of discourse dependencies
we expect. The MECO includes 12 Wikipedia-style encyclopedic text entries in each of 13 languages (representing a wide range of language types) and are read by natives of this language to record eye-movements. In each language, five texts were translated from English and the other seven share the same topics and wikipedia style with the texts in other languages. To ensure the quality of the translations, the semantic similarity of text cosines between the back-translated texts and the original English version was analyzed. In addition, there are about 10 sentences in a text, with about 15-18 words in each sentence. This suggests that these sentences are not complex and are of moderate length. This material represents the wider natural diversity of orthographic, lexical, and syntactic structures in each language. The texts in each language are small in size but representative of diverse topics. The similarity in complexity/readability of the 13 texts suggests that these texts are relatively comparable.

Overall, the texts in these different languages are quite parallel, suggesting that they are well suited for cross-linguistic study. All of this makes the annotation of discourse structure dependencies easy to manipulate. We therefore use the stimuli texts from the MECO (Siegelma et al., 2022) to develop the MCDD. Moreover, reading information (e.g., reading durations) was
assigned to each word, sentence, and text, and could be easily used for cognitive studies. We have annotated the English, German and Spanish sections.

Attached is the stimuli texts from the MECO and out annotation sample.
